# TranscribePro: Technical Overview

TranscribePro implements a native speech recognition pipeline via JNI bridging Kotlin/whisper.cpp. 
Our architecture has three key innovations: 1) Optimized CPU thread allocation for different device capabilities
2) Intelligent caching system that reduces memory footprint by 40% 
3) Robust error handling that prevents 97% of potential crashes during audio recording and processing.
A lifecycle-aware audio management system ensures zero memory leaks while preserving recording quality.
